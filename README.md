# Unity2D-CUP_UP
&lt;Platformer casual - WebGL>

Ninth game. WebGL build.

To jump left click left side of screen and to jump right click right side of screen.
Just like FALLCUP, there’s energy gauge, when cup loses all energy then it’s fainted for a second and in the meantime cup can’t fly.
Only when cup is on ground the energy is charging. Also when cup collects fruits it gains energy.
There’s some gems to collect, for hidden ending.
Cup needs to go up through all the obstacles and rescue the princess cup on the top.
